# Lecture 4: Creating Virtual Environments

## Topics

1. Helpful tips
   - Searching for imports
   - Using the console log
2. Importing and converting 3D models 
3. Exporting scene assets from Unity
4. Automated deployment to the web

## Participation Exercise

Modify the existing scene by moving at least three mesh objects loaded in `world.glb`.  To do this, you should use the debug inspector to find the node names and determine new position/rotation/scale values to use in your code.
